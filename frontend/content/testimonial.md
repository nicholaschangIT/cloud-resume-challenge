## 2nd Line Support Manager at Transputec ## 

Nicholas is a great individual with a lot of passion. He goes the extra mile when needed, and is not scared to get his hands dirty when he has too. Nicholas is one of those guys that does not make a problem stop him, and will figure it out in the long run. It was a real pleasure to have worked with him.
## Desktop Support Team leader at SSP Group ##

“I have worked with and managed Nicholas since he started at SSP in June 2018. Nicholas is very friendly and has a good approach with customers, usually greeting them with a smile. He is a very hard worker and has a professional attitude towards his work. No job is ever to too much for him, from fixing laptops, phones and even diagnosing issues with servers. He works methodically and knows when to escalate calls to 3rd parties. Nicholas identifies gaps in his knowledge and works well to research/learn to fill the gaps in. Nicholas has been an asset to the team and a well liked member of staff within the business, and I know he will continue to work hard and expand his knowledge wherever he goes”.

## Head of IT at Mobile Fun ##

“I was lucky enough to act in the capacity of Nick’s line manager during his time at Mobilefun. We recruited him for his technical abilities, enthusiasm and great attitude to customer service and support attributes that he used extensively and developed during his employment. Knowledgeable, keen and with a great approach to problem solving and accuracy, I would have no doubt Nick could excel at any role he chose”
