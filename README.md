Cloud Resume Azure Challenge

Hi! 👋  

I am following the process described by A Cloud Guru Challenge.

# My Progress #

### The website ###
​
For the website, I used a template from Hugo 
### Storage Account ###

Set up Storage container to host the site. 
​
Add a domain to the storage container and enable a CDN profile and endpoint 
## Github ## 
​
Set up Github repo to use the source code 
​
Add a Github Action and push it with CI/CD with visual studio code 

Purge CDN endpoint so it add the latest changes to your website. ​
