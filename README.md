Cloud Resume Azure Challenge

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am following the process described by A Cloud Guru Challenge.

My Progress 

The website

For the website, I used a template from Hugo 

Storage Account

Set up Storage container to host the site. 

Add a domain to the storage container and enable a CDN profile and endpoint 

Github 

Set up Github repo to use the source code 

Add a Github Action and push it with CI/CD with visual studio code 

Purge CDN endpoint so it add the latest changes to your website.
